Detecting emotion through visual feed using opencv.


To execute the main file, you need to download the fer2013 dataset file which will be available in a website called "KAGGLE". The size of the file is 101 MB. 
I have implemented just simple data augmentation and model building techniques. If you need you can add complex techniques. 

P.S: Make sure you have better configuration in your system.


For the webcam program you need haarcascade file which can be downloaded. Make sure to change the path of the files..
